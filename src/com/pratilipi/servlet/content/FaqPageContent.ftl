		<b>What does Pratilipi mean?</b>
		<br/><br/>
		Pratilipi is a Sanskrit/Hindi word which means copy. We strongly believe that every time we read a book, a part of the book comes inside of us and we become a part of the book. As George R.R Martin said: "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one". This is what Pratilipi means and stands for, to live more, and more meaningful lives.
